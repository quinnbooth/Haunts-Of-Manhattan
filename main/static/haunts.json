    "description": "Built in 1765 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the Morris-Jumel Mansion (AKA \u201cMount Morris\u201d) in Washington Heights is the oldest house in Manhattan and originally served as the summer house of Colonel Roger Morris (1727-94), a highly decorated British Army officer. In the fall of 1776, the mansion briefly served as the headquarters for General George Washington and his officers during the Revolutionary War. In 1810, Eliza and Stephen Jumel purchased the Georgian-style mansion. Eliza reportedly had an affair with Aaron Burr (the former vice president who had killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel) and soon thereafter Stephen died mysteriously from a \u201cpitchfork accident.\u201d According to popular rumors of the time, Eliza actually buried Stephen alive! Eliza and Burr divorced three years later, Burr soon died and Eliza eventually had a mental breakdown that lasted until she died in 1865 at the age of 90. Today, the Morris-Jumel Mansion is allegedly haunted by at least five spirits, including Eliza (in 1965 she allegedly shushed a group of rowdy schoolchildren who were taking a tour of the mansion), Stephen Jumel, Aaron Burr, a servant girl who reportedly committed suicide by jumping out of a window and even the painting of a Revolutionary War soldier that occasionally comes to life (a la the talking portraits that populate Hogwarts Castle!). If you\u2019re interested in possibly running into any or all of these restless spirits, the Morris-Jumel Mansion is open for self-guided tours every day but Monday.",

Tragically, John Lennon of Beatles fame was murdered outside of the Dakota on December 8, 1980 (Yoko Ono still lives at the Dakota and claims she once viewed Lennon\u2019s ghost sitting at his legendary white piano). When he was alive, Lennon apparently told Ono he witnessed a \u201cCrying Lady Ghost\u201d in the Dakota. Other ghosts witnessed by Dakota residents over the years include a playful girl in a yellow dress and a very creepy looking short guy donning an ill-fitting wig. In addition, paranormal activity reported at the Dakota includes phantom footsteps, mysterious noises and objects moving on their own. By the way, scenes from the 1968 horror movie classic Rosemary\u2019s Baby directed by Roman Polanski were shot at the Dakota, which is located at Central Park West on 72nd Street for the morbidly curious.",

Legendary author Mark Twain lived in the building for a year (1900-01) and his ghost \u2013 clad in his signature white suit and coolly smoking a cigar \u2013 has been spotted here. In fact, a plaque outside the building states, \u201cIn this house once lived Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens), author of the beloved American classic The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\u201d In 1987, the building was also the site of the tragic murder of six-year-old Lisa Steinberg by her father, Joel Steinberg, a former criminal defense attorney. Last but not least, Jan Bryant Bartell, an off-Broadway actress/poet and longtime resident of the \u201cHouse of Death,\u201d wrote a compelling 1974 memoir about her paranormal experiences there titled Spindrift: Spray from a Psychic Sea.",
